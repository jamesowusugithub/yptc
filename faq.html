<!-- TODO - FIX THIS 
 The FAQ page's instruction to "Click on the questions to reveal the answers" assumes all users
  can visually identify buttons and understand how accordion toggles work, but this could be
   more inclusive with plain-language cues 
 like "Tap or press Enter to show the answer" to support users on tablets or screen readerS.
