# YPTC â€“ Young People in Tech Careers

**YPTC** is a virtual careers hub designed to support school leavers as they explore the world of technology. Created as part of the Mayorâ€™s Fund for Londonâ€™s Employability and Skills initiative, the site brings clarity and direction to an area thatâ€™s often overwhelming â€” the world of tech careers.

The goal is simple: to make technology careers more approachable, less confusing, and genuinely exciting for young people. Instead of scattering users across dozens of confusing sites, YPTC brings together essential guidance in one place â€” with information thatâ€™s easy to understand and built around real needs.

Visitors will find an approachable space that includes opportunities to reach out to the team behind the site, explore examples of career pathways and achievements, and follow clear signposts to useful learning resources elsewhere on the web. Thereâ€™s also a frequently asked questions section to help tackle common concerns and confusion around getting started in tech.

## ðŸ’¬ A Note on Inclusivity

This site was built with the understanding that not everyone starts from the same place. The content is written in plain, friendly language to make it as accessible as possible for those who are new to the tech world â€” no prior experience needed. Whether you're curious, cautious, or confident, YPTC is here to help you take that next step.
